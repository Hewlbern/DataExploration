## Historical and Real Time Analysis Tool.
- This repo is a POC for a historical/real time analysis tool:
     - visualizations (dashboard, mapping, etc)
     - Uses Dash-Plotly
     - Features not set in stone.

#### This is the second prototype - the first used a simple django backend with html css front end. I moved onto Dash-Plotly to be able to teach easily others I work with how to code something similar, otherwise I would have built it in react.js with node.js backend and used a flask REST server for my other functions.
